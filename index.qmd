This tutorial provides a practical guide for developing educational resources in {{< fa brands r-project >}} or `Python` {{< fa brands python >}} and sharing them easily. It also aims to quickly equip you with the skills to build educational resources with __state-of-the-art level of reproducibility__. The next sections explain how to develop educational resources, and how to disseminate them on the SPPCloud. Keep in mind that this tutorial is intended for people developing resources, not for the users of these resources. Required technical prerequisites are detailed in @imp-req.

## Technical requirements to deploy educational resources

- A minimum level of proficiency in `Git` {{< fa brands git-alt >}} is required to develop and make available online training resources. However, accessing these resources on `SSPCloud` does not require any familiarity with Git.
- [`Quarto`](https://quarto.org/) {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto style="color:#74aadb;" >}}
the automated report and website builder inherited from `R Markdown`.
- An understanding of the fundamental difference between making resources available for execution on a local computer or on a server like `SSPCloud`. See [`SSPCloud` documentation](https://docs.sspcloud.fr/en/). 
- Some knowledge regarding deployment of resources using `Github Actions` {{< fa brands github >}} is useful. This tutorial gives a few templates but understanding what is happening behind the stage is not in the scope of that tutorial.

# Benefits of sharing educational resources on `SSPCloud`

Sharing educational resources on `SSPCloud` offers several advantages, particularly for educators and learners working with computational tools like R or Python. The key benefits include :

1. **Instant access via a simple link**
`SSPCloud` allows users to launch pre-configured workspaces through a simple HTTPS link. This eliminates the need for local installation or complex setup: learners can start working immediately, directly in their browser. You can find some [tutorials](https://www.sspcloud.fr/catalog) examples.

2. **Standardized and reproducible environments**
Everyone accesses the same cloud-based environment, including all necessary packages, tools, and datasets. This ensures full consistency across learners, removing issues related to differing operating systems, versions, or missing dependencies.

3. **Scalable computing power**
`SSPCloud` offers access to robust computational resources that can scale with your needs. From beginner tutorials in Python or R to advanced workflows involving large datasets or machine learning models, the platform can support a wide range of educational use cases.


As outlined in the `SSPCloud` documentation, it's important to understand that the platform separates code (Git), data (S3), and environment configuration. These components are dynamically combined when launching a compute session.

For training designers, this architecture ensures high reproducibility and fine-grained control over the environment. For users, it eliminates the need to install software, manage system permissions, or configure their local machine‚Äîmaking it easy to jump straight into the tutorial.

# Selecting appropriate training materials

When designing effective training materials, it's essential to choose formats that actively engage learners and support comprehension. While PDFs, slide decks, and videos are all valuable for delivering content, this guide focuses on static websites and interactive environments, which are particularly well-suited for hands-on learning. These environments enable learners to apply concepts immediately, test code in real time, and actively engage with the material‚Äîleading to deeper understanding and better long-term retention.

In the sections that follow, we'll begin by comparing various interactive environments based on the programming language they support. Then, we'll walk through how to build and structure them using Quarto.


## Selecting the right interactive environment 

:::: {.panel-tabset}
## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

### üìì The final product: the **interactive notebook**

`Jupyter` notebooks[^jupyter] offer an interactive interface that allows you to write `Python` code, test it, and see the result below the instruction rather than in a separate console. `Jupyter` notebooks are essential in the fields of data science and education and research because they greatly simplify exploration and experimentation.

They allow you to combine text in `Markdown` format (a lighter markup text format than `HTML` or $\LaTeX$), `Python` code, and `HTML` code for visualizations and animations in a single document.

[^jupyter]: `Jupyter` originated from the `IPython` project, an interactive environment for `Python` developed by Fernando P√©rez in 2001. In 2014, the project evolved to support other programming languages in addition to Python, leading to the creation of the Jupyter project. The name "Jupyter" is an acronym referring to the three main languages it supports: `Julia`, `Python`, and `R`.

### üõ†Ô∏è The development environment: **where you create notebooks**

Initially, `Jupyter` {{< iconify vscode-icons:file-type-jupyter >}} was the only software offering these interactive features. Now, there are other ways to benefit from notebook advantages while having an IDE with more comprehensive features than `Jupyter`. 

> üí° For this reason, as of 2025, we recommend developing resources with `VSCode` {{< iconify vscode-icons:file-type-vscode >}}, a general-purpose code editor but offering excellent features in `Python`, rather than with `Jupyter`. 

For more information on using notebooks in VSCode, refer to the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

::: {.callout-note}
Although we recommend developing resources with Vscode rather than with Jupyter, final users will be able to open your educational resources with Jupyter if they want to.
:::


![Example with `Jupyter` {{< iconify vscode-icons:file-type-jupyter >}}](/pics/jupyter.png)

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

### üìì The final product: the **Quarto Markdown file** or **HTML website**

In {{< fa brands r-project >}}, notebooks are not commonly used - even though they offer several features that are particularly valuable for educational purposes.

When designing {{< fa brands r-project >}}-based training materials, two main options are available, each with its own pros and cons:

1. **Providing access to an HTML website**
      + Advantages: Solutions to exercices can be hidden, interactive widgets can be used to offer hints or guide learners step by step, and the layout is optimized for reading.
      + Drawbacks: This is not an interactive environment‚Äîlearners must open a separate RStudio session to try out the code, which can disrupt the flow of learning.

2. **Providing access to a Quarto Markdown (.qmd) file**
      + Advantages: Fully interactive‚Äîlearners can run code directly within the environment, benefiting from live feedback and hands-on practice.
      + Drawbacks: All answers and code are visible by default, which may reduce engagement and exploratory effort from the learners.

Since the first option can become cumbersome - especially when learners need to copy and paste large blocks of code - it is generally recommended to use the second option in most cases. Providing direct access to a Quarto Markdown file helps minimize the risk of hard-to-reproduce errors that often arise when learners switch between an HTML tutorial and their R session.

### üõ†Ô∏è The development environment: **where you create your resources**

You can develop your educational resources with RStudio IDE or with VSCode, a general-purpose code editor that can also be used with Python.


### üõ†Ô∏è The development environment: **where you create your resources**

You can develop your educational resources with RStudio IDE or with VSCode, a general-purpose code editor that can also be used with Python.

![Example with RStudio](/pics/rstudio.png)


:::: 


## Using `Quarto`  {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto style="color:#74aadb;" >}} to develop training resources

`Quarto` is an open source program for creating `Python` {{< fa brands python >}} and {{< fa brands r-project >}} reproducible tutorials. 
It makes it possible to mix seamlessly code and text in the same document and can handle many output formats, including html, pdf or notebook (.ipynb extension). 

**`Quarto` is strongly recommended for the development of educational resources.**

![](pics/quarto.png)

This tutorial assumes educational resources will be available in two formats :

- `Quarto` websites - based on multiple `Quarto` files and mixing text and code chunks;
- Interactive environment (see ‚òùÔ∏è).


# Step-by-Step Guide

## Step 1: create a `Github` {{< fa brands github >}} repository from a template

### What are templates and why use them?

The very first step towards developing educational resources consists in creating a `Github` repository that will contain them all. We recommend that you use the templates developed specifically for the AIML4OS project. There are two different templates, depending on the language you want to use. They are both hosted on Github {{< fa brands github >}}: 

* {{< fa brands r-project >}}: [template](https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-r)
* `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}: [template](https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python).

These templates contain all what you need to produce resources that can be easily made available as websites or as interactive environments on  SSPCloud. More precisely, these templates contain:

- a minimal `Quarto` website with visual elements reflecting AIML4OS aesthetic;
- a minimal example of a `Quarto` document producing a Jupyter Notebook ({{< fa brands python >}} only);
- a minimal example of a `Quarto` document mixing Markdown text and `R` code ({{< fa brands r-project >}} only);
- what is needed to manage dependencies (what packages are needed to run the codes, and in which version);
- scripts for `Github Actions` workflow for automated deployment (don't be afraid, see below!).

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## If you are not AIML4OS member and follow this guide anyway

You can still use the templates - just remove the AIML4OS-styled components. 

:::

### How to use a template?

Here is what to do to re-use a template:

- Go to the `Github` {{< fa brands github >}} page of the chosen template;
- Click on the _"Use this template"_ button and then on _"Create a new repository"_ (see @fig-template);

![Use this template button on `Github`](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-76823/mw-1440/images/help/repository/use-this-template-button.webp){#fig-template width=50% fig-align="center"}

- Choose carefully the owner and the name of the new repository:
  - `Owner`: by default the owner is the creator of the fork, but it may be preferable to choose a Github organization (for instance the `AIML4OS` organization);
  - `Name`: give the repository a meaningful name, for instance _"Intro_To_Deep_Learning"_ or _"Intro_To_Linear_Regression"_;

- Set `Choose visibility` to `Public`.


## Step 2: define your development configuration on `SSPCloud`

<!-- get started with `Quarto`  {{< iconify simple-icons:quarto style="color:#74aadb;" >}} -->

`SSPCloud` is not only useful to disseminate educational resources; it is also the right place to develop them. Doing so will facilitate resource dissemination as the environment used for training will be equivalent to the one used for development. In other words, __we strongly recommend developing on [SSPCloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr) as it will greatly improve the reproducibility of your educational resources__.

Some elements of this development environment will be re-used to provide a ready-to-use configuration for learners. However, learners don't need to be familiar with the technical concepts of configuration: pre-configured environments do exist so that learners can concentrate on acquiring skills!

### What is a configuration and why is it useful?

The best way to develop resources on `SSPCloud` is to define your own development configuration. In technical terms, __a configuration is just a service available on `SSPCloud` (eg: `RStudio` or `VSCode`) with additional user-defined settings__ such as: the Github repository you want to work on, your Github credentials, the size of memory and number of CPU you want to use, the initialization script you want to run...

Defining a configuration has two advantages:

- it lets you define explicitly the technical environment you want to use for a specific project;
- you can resume working on your project at any time in only one click, and be sure that the technical environment remains exactly the same.

Your ready-to-use configurations are listed on the right-hand-side of the "My services" tab. To use a configuration, you just have to click on `Launch` (red rectangle). You can modify or delete an existing configuration by clicking on the contextual menu (green rectangle).

![](pics/SSPCloud4.png){width=600}


::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
Defining a configuration may seem complicated at first, but you‚Äôll quickly get the hang of it.
:::

### How to define a configuration

Here is how to define a ready to use development configuration using `SSPCloud`. A video version is proposed below the text.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="false"}
## Git Configuration

If you're using `SSPCloud` for the first time, you must configure your personal access token on GitHub in order to access to your GitHub repository (see [version control](https://docs.sspcloud.fr/content/version-control.html) for more details).
You don't have to configure your GitHub personal token access every time afterwards.
:::

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

- In the [SSPCloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr), go to the "My Services" Tab and click on "New Service";
- Choose Rstudio and click Launch;
- Customize the configuration by changing four settings:
  + In the "Initialization scripts" tab, paste this URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{OWNER}/{REPO}/refs/heads/main/init.sh`, after replacing `OWNER` and `REPO` by the owner and repository name you chose in step 1;
  + In the "Friendly Name" field, choose a meaningful name (for instance `dev_Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);   
  + In the "Repository" field of the "Git" tab, paste the URL of the repository you created in step 1 (for instance: `https://www.github.com/AIML4OS/Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);
  + In the "Network Access" tab, enable access to your service through port 5000;
- Click on Save configuration;
- Click on Launch and open the Rstudio service (this may take a few minutes, see box below);
- Rename the Rproj file with a meaningful name (for instance `Intro_To_Linear_Regression.Rproj`), commit this change and push it;
- You‚Äôre ready to go!

:::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## Rstudio services start slowly!
__Rstudio services may take a lot of time to start__ (up to 10 minutes!), because installing dependencies with `renv` is quite slow. If you get a time-out error, close and re-open the service (but do not delete it!), it will open eventually.
::::

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

- In the [SSPCloud](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr), go to the "My Services" Tab and click on "New Service";
- Choose `Vscode-python` and click `Launch`[^options-ide];
- Customize the configuration by changing four settings:
  + In the "Initialization scripts" tab, paste this URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{OWNER}/{REPO}/refs/heads/main/init.sh`, after replacing `OWNER` and `REPO` by the owner and repository name you chose in step 1;
  + In the "Friendly Name" field, choose a meaningful name (for instance `dev_Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);   
  + In the "Repository" field of the "Git" tab, paste the URL of the repository you created in step 1 (for instance: `https://www.github.com/AIML4OS/Intro_To_Linear_Regression`);
  + In the "Network Access" tab, enable access to your service through port 5000;
- Click on Save configuration;
- Click on Launch;
- Open the Vscode service;
- You‚Äôre ready to go!

[^options-ide]: By default, this service includes a `Python` installation, but does not offer additional software such as `R`. For multi-language training, you can use the `Vscode-r-python-julia` service.
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse="false"}
## Video version

Here's a video summarizing these manual gestures for configuring the Python environment. Setting up the R environment is very similar. The values entered in the fields, in particular the initialization script, are those given in the example above: adapt these values to your needs.

```{=html}
<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><iframe src="https://zoom.us/clips/embed/wGjagl_4RIemXEN98xvARg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; top: 0; left: 0;"></iframe></div>
```

:::

### How to use an existing configuration

Once a configuration is defined, using it is very easy and very fast:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

- Go the "My Services" Tab;
- On the right side of the screen, find the configuration of your project and click on Launch;
- Open the Rstudio service;
- Click on the Rproj file to open the RStudio project (this may take a while because `renv` is slow at installing packages);
- You‚Äôre ready to go!

:::: {.callout-important collapse="false"}
## Rstudio services start slowly!
__Rstudio services may take a lot of time to start__ (up to 10 minutes!), because installing dependencies with `renv` is quite slow. If you get a time-out error, close and re-open the service (but do not delete it!), it will open eventually.
::::

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

- Go the "My Services" Tab;
- On the right side of the screen, find the configuration of your project and click on Launch;
- Open the VSCode service;
- You‚Äôre ready to go!

:::

## Step 3: develop resources with Quarto

If you have created a repository from a template and defined a development configuration, developing resources basically means modifying and extending the minimal examples available in your repository.

### Change the URLs

The first thing you must do is change the URLs of the repository in the `_quarto.yml` file:

- Open the `_quarto.yml`;
- in the `site-url` and  `repo-url` fields, replace the URL of the template by the URL of your repository. In step 1, you chose the `Owner` and the `Name` of your repository, so the URL should be `https://github.com/{Owner}/{Name}`;
- Commit this change.

### Manage data (if needed)

Depending on your project, your scripts may require some data, for instance to train a model. However, when you start a service on `SSPCloud` (VSCode or Rstudio), it does not contain any data. That implies that you have to download data into your service. Of course, you _could_ do it by hand every time you start a service, but we strongly recommend that you automatize this step. The simplest way to proceed is to upload your data on the S3 storage service of SSPCloud, and then download it from S3 into your service every time you start a service.

#### Upload data to S3

The simplest way to upload data to S3 is to use the graphical interface available on SSPCloud. __You have to do only once__ (except if you want to change or update the data, of course). To do so, click on "File Explorer" on the left hand and then on "My data".

![](pics/SSPCloud6.png){width=700}

You can upload a file by navigating clicking on "Upload file" (blue rectangle). You can also create a subfolder by clicking on "Create directory" (red rectangle).

![](pics/SSPCloud7.png){width=700}

:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
## Three remarks to keep in mind

- Choose carefully in which subfolder you upload your files, because moving files from one subfolder to another one on S3 is not very convenient.
- Remember that only __open data__ can be uploaded on S3.
- By default, only you can see the files upload in your bucket. If you want other people to access the data, __do not forget to make publicly available__ by clicking on the eye on the right hand side (green rectangle). 

Once again: no sensitive data!!

::::

#### Download data

To download data automatically into your service, you just have to adapt the `download_data.sh` file (in the `sspcloud` folder of your template). There are two things you can change:

- `DEST_DIR` is the folder in your service where data will be downloaded (`/home/data/` by default);
- `DATA_PATH` is the S3 path to your data (where it is downloaded from).

To obtain the S3 path to your data, use the File Explorer to navigate and find the file you want. The S3 path of your file is simply the path of the folder available in the top right corner of the explorer (red rectangle) and the name of the file (blue rectangle). In the screenshot below, the path of the first file is then: `s3/oliviermeslin/data_SILC_PUF/data_SILC_d2013.parquet`.

![](pics/SSPCloud8.png){width=700}


### How to write Quarto documents?

Most of the resources you will develop will take the form of Quarto documents, that you will either provide to final users or compile to final outputs (for instance, websites or Jupyter notebooks). Therefore, you must learn how to use Quarto. Fortunately, Quarto is easy to use, has an amazing [documentation](https://quarto.org/) and there are plenty of resources online to help you.

### Developing resources

Developing resources (html pages published on the website or interactive environments) with the AIML4OS templates is very easy: you just have to write text and code chunks in the existing `qmd` files (`index.qmd` and `chapter1.qmd`) or to add new Quarto documents. Two important remarks: 

- The `index.qmd` file is the starting page of your project: __you should not delete or rename it.__
- __You must specify the output format you want in the header of each qmd file__: 

    - if you want a static html page, specify `format: html`;
    - if you want a Jupyter notebook (Python only), specify `format: ipynb`;
    - if you want a Quarto file with `R` chunks (`R` only), do not specify anything.
    

<!-- If you add a new document, you must add it to the list in the `render` argument of the `_quarto.yml` file, so that Quarto compiles it. An important point is that the `index.qmd` file will be the starting page of your website: __you should not delete or rename it.__ -->

#### Building and previewing your website

The first kind of output you may want to produce is a static website, consisting in a series of html documents. If you add new pages to the website (preferably in the `chapters` subdirectory), __do not forget to add them to the structure of the website__ by modifying the `_quarto.yml` file in two places: in the `render` argument (so that Quarto compiles them), and in the `contents` of the `sidebar` argument (so that all chapters are in the sidebar of the website). 

It is often convenient to have a look at what this website looks like while developing it. You can preview your website from the command line by running:

```{.bash}
quarto preview --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then go to [https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/my-services](https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/my-services), open the README of the service you are using and click on the link to the external port.

::: {#fig-port5000 layout-ncol=2}

![](pics/SSPCloud2.png){width=350}

![](pics/SSPCloud3.png){width=400}

Accessing website preview
:::


:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
## What to do if you can't access the website preview?

If the website preview is inaccessible due to a missing link in the README, you may have forgotten to open port 5000 in your configuration. This is easily solved: 

- Close your RStudio/VSCode service (after committing and pushing all changes!);
- Modify your configuration: in the "Network Access" tab, enable access to your service through port 5000 and save this new configuration;
- Launch again your RStudio/VSCode service.
::::

#### Creating interactive scripts

The second kind of output you may want to produce are interactive environments. These are particularly useful if your resources contain exercises. The final outputs will be quite different for `R` and Python (`Jupyter` notebooks for `Python`, Quarto documents with `R` chunks for `R`), but these resources can nonetheless be developed using Quarto.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

Here is how you can produce a Quarto file with `R` chunks:

- Create a new Quarto file and store it in the `exercices` subfolder; 
- Develop the content;
- Do __NOT__ add the qmd file to the list in the `render` argument of the `_quarto.yml` file. This file does not need compilation.

The `notebooks` subfolder of the `R` template already contains an example.

:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
__You should not use `install.packages()` _anywhere_ in your `R` resources__ because it is not the proper way to manage package requirements (see below for recommendations on dependency management).
::::

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

Here is how you can produce a Jupyter notebook for Python:

- Create a new Quarto file and store it in the `notebooks` subfolder; 
- Do not forget to write `format: ipynb` in the header;
- Develop the content;
- Add the qmd file to the list in the `render` argument of the `_quarto.yml` file, so that Quarto compiles it into a Jupyter notebook.

The `notebooks` subfolder of the `Python` template already contains an example (`notebook1.qmd`).

:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
__You should not use `pip install` _anywhere_ in your notebooks__ because it is not the proper way to manage package requirements (see below for recommendations on dependency management).
::::

:::


### Handling dependencies when developing resources

A major challenge in any data science project is to __make sure that its codes can be re-run without error by someone working in a different environment__ (this is called __portability__). Various technical requirements must be met to ensure portability; one of them is to keep track of all packages needed to run the code (and of the exact version of each package!), so that a new user can reinstall them easily. 
The dependency management tool depends on the language you use:


- If you use `R`, we recommend that you use `renv`;
- If you use `Python`, we recommend that you use `uv`.


::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

`renv` is an R package that helps you manage the dependencies of each of your projects. It means that `renv` lets you keep track of what packages are needed to run your code, and in what exact version. More precisely, using `renv` adds two specific files to your project:

- The lockfile `renv.lock` records information about every package used in the project, so that these packages can be re-installed on a new machine;
- the `.Rprofile` project file. This file is run automatically every time you start `R` so that `renv` is used properly.

Here is how to use `renv`:

- The first step in using `renv` is to initiate the tracking of dependencies using `renv::init()`. __You do not need to do it if you use the `R` template__ because this was already done in the template.
- When developing resources, you should regularly run `renv::snapshot()`. This command will analyze your `R` and Quarto scripts, detects what packages are used, and updates the `renv.lock` file. Do not forget to commit and push the changes to the `renv.lock` file!
- When you start working on your project with a new service, you should run `renv::restore()`. This command will reinstall all the packages listed in the `renv.lock` file.

::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
If you forget to update the `renv.lock` file, your Github Actions workflow is likely to fail, and you probably won't be able to execute your `R` script in a new RStudio service. Keep calm, here is the solution: just run `renv::snapshot()`, commit and push the changes to the `renv.lock` file. This should solve the problem.
:::

For more information, see the [official documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) of `renv`.

## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

`uv` is a fast Python package manager that helps you **track and manage dependencies per project**, similarly to `renv` for R. More precisely, `uv` can be used to create a __virtual environment__ for your Python project. A virtual environment contains your project's Python and its packages, and is isolated from other projects and the system's Python. This means that different projects can use different versions of packages (and even different versions of Python!) without conflicts. `uv` helps create and manage these virtual environments easily, making sure all needed packages for your project are installed and kept organized. Using `uv`, you can ensure your project is reproducible, fast to install, and easy to deploy.


Here is the very short introduction on how to use `uv`:

- The basic command to start using `uv` is `uv init`. This command adds to your project the `pyproject.toml` file that defines the project dependencies and metadata. This file is the central piece of the dependency management.  __You do not need to use this command if you use the Python template__ because this has already been done (the template already contains a `pyproject.toml` file).

- When you start using a new package in your project, you must explicitly add it to the dependencies by running the command `uv add [package_name]`. This command will add this package to the `pyproject.toml` file.

- Commit and push the changes in the `pyproject.toml` file.

- When you want to recreate your environment from scratch on a new machine (or in a new service), you must run the command `uv sync`. This command will install all packages specified in the `pyproject.toml` file (and their own dependencies). __You do not need to use this command if you use use the Python template__ because the initialization script already runs `uv sync`.

:::: {.callout-warning collapse="false"}
If you forget to use `uv add [package_name]` to add to your `pyproject.toml` file, your Github Actions workflow is likely to fail, and you probably won't be able to execute your Python script in a new VSCode service. Keep calm, here is the solution: just identify what are the missing packages, use `git add`, commit and push the changes to the `pyproject.toml` file. This should solve the problem.
::::

## Step 4: set up a Github pages website

__This step is optional__, depending on whether your resources include a website. You can skip this step if your resources consist only in interactive environments (Jupyter notebooks for `Python`, interactive Quarto documents with `R` chunks for `R`).

### What are Github Actions and Github pages and why are they useful?

If you are developing a website or Jupyter Notebooks for educational purposes, you probably want to publish them online. If you perform the publication manually (building the website/notebooks, then publishing them), you'll have to re-do this series of tasks every time you change your website. This is time-consuming, repetitive and boring. But fortunately, you can automate this process thanks to GitHub Actions and Github Pages:

- GitHub Actions is a tool built into GitHub that runs pre-defined tasks like testing, building, and deploying code when specific events occur in a repository. For instance, GitHub Actions may perform a series of task every time you push on the `main` branch of your repository, without you doing anything manually. 
- GitHub Pages is a another tool from Github that lets you publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository; it is often used for project documentation or personal portfolios.

The main message is: __by combining GitHub Actions with GitHub Pages, you can set things up so that every time you make changes to your repository, GitHub Actions automatically updates your website and publishes it on GitHub Pages.__ This will save you a lot of time!

### Create the `gh-pages` branch

When developing resources, you will most likely use the `main` branch. However, for `Github Actions` to work, you need an additional branch `gh-pages` used by Github to deploy websites. This one will be rewritten automatically by `Github` after every Github Actions workflow. However, you need to create it first. __This should be done only once.__ Quarto documentation gives this command to create that branch. __Be careful with that command, do not use before having done a first push on Github.__

```{.bash}

git checkout --orphan gh-pages # Create an empty branch called gh-pages 
git reset --hard # make sure all changes are committed before running this!
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initialising gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages # Pushing so that the gh-pages branch exists on the remote repo
git checkout main
```

### Setting up a Github Actions workflow

You need to define a Github Actions workflow to automate output construction and deployment. A GHA workflow is a list of instructions (for instance: install `R`, install packages...) that are executed automatically every time a certain event happens (for instance every time you push on the main branch). A GHA workflow is defined using specific `yaml` scripts, located in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. __The templates already contain standard workflows that you can use as a starting point.__ We recommend that you have a careful look at these workflows; comments were added so that they are easy to follow.

A few important remarks on automated deployment:

- The website is deployed at an URL that depends on the owner and the name of the repository: `https://{REPO_OWNER}.github.io/{REPO_NAME}/`. Don't forget to change the `site-url` in the `_quarto.yml` file of your template to `https://{REPO_OWNER}.github.io/{REPO_NAME}/`.
- You can monitor Github Actions jobs in the "Actions" tab of the Github repository of your project. Do not be afraid if your jobs fail at first; getting Github Actions to work often requires some debugging.

### Add the website URL to your Github repository

You can add the website URL to your Github repository so that it is easier to find. To do so, go to your repository using your browser, click on the little wheel on the far right (see the screenshot below), paste your website URL in the `Website` field, and save changes.

::: {.callout-important}
## What should you do to update your website? Absolutety nothing!!!

If the settings of your Github Actions and Github Pages are well defined, you do not have to do anything to update the website. You just have to modify your Quarto files (for instance by adding a paragraph), commit and push these changes to the `main` branch: __the site will be updated automatically__. It may take a few minutes for GitHub Actions to propagate the changes to your Github Pages website. That's why it's often more convenient to develop your GitHub Page using Onyxia, where you can preview all your updates instantly within just a few seconds.

You can also follow the Github Actions workflow in the `Actions` tab of your repository.

## Step 5: make your interactive environments easily available on `SSPCloud`

__This step is optional__, depending on whether your resources include interactive environments (Jupyter notebooks for `Python`, interactive Quarto documents with `R` chunks for `R`). You can skip this step if your resources consist only in a Quarto website.




::: {.callout-warning}
## Python only: accessing the `Jupyter Notebooks`

Notebooks are automatically made available through the website deployed via Github Actions. Their location on the website depends on the location of of the qmd used to build them within the Git repository. For example, the notebook available in the Python template will be accessible via [this link](https://aiml4os.github.io/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/notebooks/notebook1.ipynb) because the qmd file `notebook1.qmd` is located in the `AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/notebooks/` folder of the repository.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## `R` only: accessing the Quarto files

Quarto exercise files with `R` chunks can be used directly, no compilation is necessary. As a consequence, they are located on the Github repository, not on the website. To use these files, you must use the __raw Github URL__. This URL is available by clicking on the `raw` button when opening the file on Github. For example, the exercise available in the `R` template will be accessible via [this link](https://aiml4os.github.io/AIML4OS-template-quarto-r/exercises/exercise1.qmd) because the qmd file `exercise1.qmd` is located in the `AIML4OS-template-quarto-r/exercises` folder of the repository.

### The initialization script for trainees

Up to now, we have explained how to initialize and pre-configure the __trainers'__ development environment (with the `init.sh` script). It is important to understand that while this pre-configuration is convenient but not essential when building educational resources, defining such a pre-configured environment is __mandatory__ when making ready-to-use tutorials available to trainees. For this purpose, the _templates_ offer an example to be edited, depending on the URL on which your resources are made available.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## `Python` {{< fa brands python >}}

The script `init-trainees.sh` provided in the `sspcloud` folder of the _template_ helps you to configure the environment for trainees on `SSPCloud`. This script does two things: install the environment needed to run the notebook and download the notebook you want to provide trainees with. 

__You do not need to modify this script.__ This script takes only one argument: the path of the notebook within the website (see next section). If the notebook you want to make available is located at is available at <https://aiml4os.github.io/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/notebooks/notebook1.ipynb>, then this argument should be `notebooks/notebook1.ipynb`.

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

The script `init-trainees.sh` provided in the `sspcloud` folder of the _template_ helps you to configure the environment for trainees on `SSPCloud`. This script does two things: install the environment needed to run the notebook and open the Quarto file you want to provide trainees with. 

__You do not need to modify this script.__ This script takes only one argument: the path of the Quarto file within the Github repository (see next section). If the Quarto file you want to make available is located at is available at <https://github.com/AIML4OS/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/blob/main/chapters/chapter1.qmd>, then this argument should be `chapters/chapter1.qmd`.


:::

::: {.callout-important}
## How to use the initialization script

When using initialization script, you **must put** the __raw github URL__ of the script in the `Initialization scripts` field of the  configuration of your `SSPCloud` service. This URL is available by clicking on the `raw` button when opening the file on Github (see screenshot below). The URL should have a pattern similar to this one: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InseeFrLab/AIML4OS-template-quarto-python/refs/heads/main/sspcloud/init-trainees.sh>.

### Setting up an auto launch URL

A convenient feature of `SSPCloud` is that you can make a whole training environment available through one URL link: in one click, trainees open a VSCode service that contains a Jupyter notebook, the data used by the notebook, all dependencies needed to run the notebook, and sufficient resources to run the code.

To do so, just follow two steps:

- Define all aspects of the training environment using the usual interface. Here are the elements you will probably want to configure:

  - `Friendly Name`: do not forget to use a meaningful name ("Intro_To_Deep_Learning"), that will be more convenient for trainees;
  - `Resources`: choose the requests and limits that are well-suited for your use case. Some trial-and-error might be necessary here. However, __in most cases, you don't need to change the resources there__ because default settings of `SSPCloud` fit most needs. 
  - `Initialization scripts`: 

    - `Use a custom script (URL)`: paste the URL to the initialization script for trainees (see previous section).
    - `Arguments for the custom script`: write the name of the notebook (see previous section).

  - `GIT`: In the "Repository" field, paste the URL of the Github repository containing the training resources.

- Copy the link provided at the top of the interface by clicking on "Copy Auto Launch URL", and paste it wherever you want. Anyone with an `SSPCloud` account can use it to open a pre-configured service. __Do not forget to test your link a few times to be sure it works__. Do not be afraid if it does not work on the first time, some trial-and-error is often necessary.

![](pics/SSPCloud5.png){width=600}

::: {.callout-note}

An auto-launch URL is typically very long, something like: <https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python?name=Notebook1&version=2.3.18&s3=region-79669f20&init.personalInit=¬´https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAIML4OS%2FAIML4OS-template-quarto-python%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fsspcloud%2Finit-trainees.sh¬ª&init.personalInitArgs=¬´notebooks%2Fnotebook1.ipynb¬ª&git.repository=¬´https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAIML4OS%2FAIML4OS-template-quarto-python.git¬ª&autoLaunch=true>

We recommend two things:

- __Read carefully the auto-launch URL__ a few times (don't be afraid!). You will see that it simply contains all the elements you defined in the configuration: the service you want to use (VSCode/RStudio), the friendly name, the URL of the init script and so on. This is not so complicated!
- __Check that there is no sensitive information in the Autolaunch URL__ (such as your Github token). If something looks strange, take the time to understand what is the problem.
:::

### Adding a launch button to your website (bonus)

Let's say you have done everything described before, and you have a working auto-launch URL. You could of course send it to trainees and ask them to copy and paste it in their browser to access the service, but a ready-to-use button is much more user-friendly! Just take this code snippet as a basis and replace `AUTOLAUNCH_URL_THERE` with your own quick launch URL:

::: {.panel-tabset}

## {{< fa brands r-project >}}

```bash
<a href="AUTOLAUNCH_URL_THERE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-original-href="AUTOLAUNCH_URL_THERE"><img src="https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/SSP%20Cloud-Launch_with_RStudio-blue?logo=vsc&amp;logoColor=white" alt="Onyxia"></a>

which, when formatted, will give a button like this

### Add your resources on the training webpage hosted on `SSPCloud`

If you are ready to make your resources available to trainees, just send an email to innovation@insee.fr, and the IT Innovation Team of Insee will help you through the process of publishing your resources on `SSPCloud`.

<!-- ## Make a ready to use link to your resources

Let's assume now you want learners to avoid copy-pasting code from your program to their sandbox environment. `SSPCloud` proposes a feature that enables to launch a ready to use sandbox with one click. This enables to start an environment that can be overloaded by some parameters that would make learners ready to start their learning experience.
