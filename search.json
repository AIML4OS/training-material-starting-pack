    "text": "Step 1: create a Github repository from a template\nThe very first step towards developing educational resources consists in creating a Github repository that will contain them all. We recommend that you use templates developed specifically for the AIML4OS project. Depending on the language you want to use, there is a template for R and a template for Python.\nHere is a simple procedure to re-use a template:\n\nGo to the Github page of the chosen template (R or Python);\nClick on the ![https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/GitHub_Fork_Button.png] button;\nChoose carefully the owner and the name of the new repository: - Owner: by default the owner is the creator of the fork, but it may be preferable to choose a Github organization (for instance the AIML4OS organization); - Name: give the repository a meaningful name, for instance “Intro_To_Deep_Learning” or “Intro_To_Linear_Regression”.\nDissociate the fork from the original template. To do so, go to the Github page of the new repository, click on Settings, scroll down to the Danger Zone and click on “Leave fork network”."

This will facilitate resource dissemination as the environment used for training will be equivalent to the one used for development. In otyher words, we strongly recommend that you develop on the SSPCloud because this will help a lot to make your educational resources reproducible.\nHere is a simple procedure to develop resources on the SSP-Cloud:\n\nRPython\n\n\n\nGo the “My Services” Tab (red box);\nClick on “New Service” (green box);\n![pics/SSPCloud1.png]\nChoose Rstudio and click Launch, and Launch again;\nOpen the Rstudio service;\nClone the repository you created in step 1 (for instance: https://www.github.com/AIML4OS/Intro_To_Linear_Regression) using RStudio clone button.\n\n\n\n\nWhen developing Quarto resources, it is easier to use VSCode than Jupyter. This does not mean that you are forcing your trainees to use VSCode, they will be able to open your output with Jupyter.\nOpen a service with this link: https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/launcher/ide/vscode-python?name=vscode-python&version=2.1.18&s3=region-ec97c721&networking.user.enabled=true\nFork repository to get your own editable template.\nWe assume you’re cloning that repository\ngit clone XXXXX\nYou can delete resources/r.qmd. Open and have a look to resources/python.qmd in your local repository.\n\n\n\nDepending on the language you want to use, you can lighten the repository of unnecessary elements.\n\nRPython\n\n\nYou can delete resources/python.qmd.\nOpen, have a look to and update resources/r.qmd in your local repository.\n\n\nYou can delete resources/r.qmd.\nOpen, have a look to and update resources/python.qmd in your local repository.\n\n\n\nNow assuming you want to give access to your resources as an html website, from command line you can preview your website using\nquarto preview --port 5000 --host 0.0.0.0\nThen go to https://datalab.sspcloud.fr/my-services, open the README of the service you use and click on the section regarding external port opened [capture à faire].\n\nRPython\n\n\nYou can jump to next session\n\n\nIt makes more sense to provide your trainees with a jupyter notebook. To generate it, you can write\nquarto render --to ipynb\nNotebooks will be written in the _site folder\n\n\n\nWe’ll now assume that you’re satisfied with the resources you’ve built and want to make them available to your trainees."
